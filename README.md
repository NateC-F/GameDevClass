  This project was completed during the Fall 2025 semester at WSU. While the game is not fully finished, we successfully developed a game engine from scratch using Java. I served as one of the two lead developers. Outside of class, I had to conceptualizing the game,
designing the first level, and preparing a pitch for the course. Throughout the semester, all team members contributed to the development of the engine. My specific contributions included implementing the SamuraiBoss, Collectibles, Chests, Coins, and Keys classes, 
as well as assisting with hitbox functionality. As a lead developer, I also helped debug team members’ code and oversaw the integration of their contributions.
